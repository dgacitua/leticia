  LETICIA is a web platform provided as an open-source solution to deploy study designs in the Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) field. Besides deploying these studies, LETICIA can conduct them and collect various types of data from user's interactions. LETICIA presents several features out of the box that can be customized to researchers' needs: A built-in search engine, a tool to build document collections, an interactive application programming interface (API), a data logger, and a session flow manager.
